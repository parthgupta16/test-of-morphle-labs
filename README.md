This is a simple Flask application that displays system information, such as the current server time, username, and output from the top command. To set it up, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Ensure Flask is installed using pip install flask. To run the application, open the terminal, navigate to the folder, and execute python app.py. The server will start, and you can access the system details by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/htop or the forwarded Codespace URL in your browser. If using Codespaces, make sure port 5000 is forwarded.
